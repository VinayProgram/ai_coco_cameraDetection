ML models

Models take some inputs and can give you outputs based on linear algebra

Models need to be trained with the data so each time you give the input it will learn and give the output

it shows the result with certain level of confidence and will give the output which whould be helpful to decide the logic

there are many types of ML learning models is 

Supervised learning 
Supervised learning models take the data with the labels and models will start identifying the models and train the models 

example 
if you show an apple and give the label as ball
and then show ball and give the label as apple machine learning with learn the following methodolgy and will give the output



Unsupervised Learning
The following learning is required where the data is unknown with labels finding paterns in unlabelled data 

the output will give the classes and to learn it from objects and then give the output and the the classes need to be thrown to supervised learning to label it carfully
