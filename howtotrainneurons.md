linear regression using single neuron

let neuron=neuron()
let num={num:4,weoght:6}
let bias = 5

const neuronValue=neuron(num,bias)

29=6*4+5

activaton function

loss functions
the lesser the mse loss is the more accurate data tends tobe


example

const input={1,2,3,4,5}
const expectedOutput={1,4,6,8,10}
the above function would be higher mse output as the out wont match with following
we need to reduce the count to make it lesser
