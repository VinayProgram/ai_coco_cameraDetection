when and image is given to the tensors in number format it will return a tensor of array which is mostly in normalised format 

but what is normalised format

when we have a range of values such as 

let a=[1,2,3,4,5] and let b=[-4,-3,-2,-1,0,1]

and we want to compare them we create a normalized format 
for example if we want to compare 1 in arrays both have diffrent positions in it

a has the lowest range value of 1 while b has the highest 
we can compare it by normalising it 

normalisation works
lowest number of a and highest number of a
Range(max number - min number)
range is of a is 5
a= 5-1
a=4

range of b is 5
max num=1
min num=-4
1-(-4)
b=5

if we check b>a

and hence we can compare the normalised form

and if we want orignal value we can multiply it by pixels
