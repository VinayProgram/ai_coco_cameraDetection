human brain connects 86 billion brain neurons
each neuron is weighted diffrently
neurons get actives on trigeer points when you see somthing 


-----

artifical neuron
on neutron is known as percepton
on percepton have multiple inputs
and each input is given the weight which matters the most

lets considers 

const neurom=neuron()

const a={w:5,num=4}
const b={w:3,num=6}
const c={w:3,num=5}
const d={w:2,num=3}
const e={w:1,num=1}

each assgined value is considered as weight  and number
all the values are passed to neuron as

neurom=neuron(a,b,c,d,e)

the neuroan is given a bias value and then its added to caluclte the values of neuron with the given weights and numbers

each values are multipled by the weight and num and then added to make a neuron number with bias adding

in the following function neuron has multiple activation functions which calculate the value of regresion  with linear alegebra

activation functions are

indentity
binary step
logistic
relu and much more


all the values are drawed on graph and ploted on x and y axis

and then its decided to give the value 

there are functions like
